  <p>I'm a 24 year old who went to college right out of high school. I went to college and earned a Bachelor's degree in Accountancy. I have a wife a dog and a house. After graduating I went on to be a State Tax Auditor. I found that this career was great but not the one for me. Coding has helped me create and learn more about the technology we use everyday. I'm excited to see where coding will take me.</p>
